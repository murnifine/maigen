I created this app to speed up my work in filling in metadata for microstock content.

By using advanced AI services that analyze images and propose accurate metadata such as titles, keywords, and categories. 

I kept the interface as minimal as possible to make it easy to use.

I also included some other additional features based on user suggestions.
